                <p>Woocite excels at building, delivering, and maintaining web application. We Keep up with the technology and always use the latest and best techniques and tools</p>
            
                <h1>Ruby on Rails</h1>
                <p>Woocite has been working with Ruby on Rails for 10+ years. We were early adopters of Ruby on Rails after seeing how much more productive we could be with Rails than other technologies. As we worked more and more with Ruby on Rails, our passion for it grew. We started understanding how the true nuts and bolts of Ruby on Rails work, and we even became active open-source contributors to build and improve features and the framework.</p>
            
                <h1>React.js</h1>
                <p>React.js is a JavaScript library used to build client rich applications. It is incredibly fast and works nicely with existing web applications. We like it so much we even wrote a book on this technology.</p>
            
                <h1>Node.js</h1>
                <p>With an extensive community and a massive number of open source libraries, Node.js is one of the most preferred server-side frameworks and it enables us to deliver highly performant and scalable applications.</p>

    <h1>Mobile App Development</h1>
    <p>Native apps require two different teams to build the iOS app and Android app. This can be frustrating, time consuming, and costly. React Native allows us to build both the iOS and Android app using the same code.</p>

    <h1>React Native</h1>
    <p>React Native uses familiar web technologies like JavaScript, React.js and Redux to build mobile apps. The toolchain developed by the React Native team makes it easier to both develop and debug the application.</p>
